# Full Stack Development Study Plan

Welcome to my Full Stack Development study plan! As a UX Designer with a passion for understanding how designs are implemented, I embarked on a self-study journey to learn full stack development. This plan is a culmination of my efforts and insights.

## Introduction

Curiosity drove me to explore the world of full stack development. As a designer, I wanted to understand the implementation of designs from a developer's perspective. This journey has not only broadened my skill set but also deepened my appreciation for the development process.

## Why Start with Front End?

If you're new to full stack development, I highly recommend starting with front end technologies. The front end is generally easier to grasp, process, and work with, making it an excellent entry point for beginners. Unless you're already a coding ninja, diving into the front end first will provide a solid foundation and a more manageable learning curve.

## Study Plan Overview

My study plan is structured to guide you through the fundamental concepts and skills needed for full stack development. It covers essential topics, resources, and practical projects to help you build a strong foundation. Whether you're a complete beginner or looking to enhance your existing skills, this plan can serve as a helpful roadmap.
